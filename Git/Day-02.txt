What is Git:
"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency"

Git is a distributed peer-peer version control system. Each node in the network is a peer, storing entire repositories which can also act as a multi-node distributed back-ups. There is no specific concept of a central server although nodes can be head-less or 'bare', taking on a role similar to the central server in centralised version control systems.


What is GitHub:
"GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features."

Github provides access control and several collaboration features such as wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature requests for every project.

GitHub (and any other local, remote or hosted system) can all be peers in the same distributed versioned repositories within a single project.

Github allows you to:

Share your repositories with others.
Access other user's repositories.
Store remote copies of your repositories (github servers) as backup of your local copies.
